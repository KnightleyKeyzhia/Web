    <h3>About</h3>
    <p><b>Excalibur</b> is the mythical sword of King Arthur that may possess magical powers or be associated with the rightful sovereignty of Britain. <br>Traditionally, the sword in the stone that is the proof of Arthur's lineage and the sword given him by a Lady of the Lake are not the same weapon,</br> even as in some versions of the legend both of them share the name of Excalibur. Several similar swords and other weapons also appear within Arthurian texts, <br>as well as in other legends.</br></p>
    <h3>Detail</h3>
    <p>A very powerful weapon, the name Excalibur means 'cut-steel', <br>and it was supposedly made by an Avalonian elf and forged in dragon-fire.</br></p>

As a first step, Yoda acquired a kyber crystal from the icy caverns of Ilum,</br> a mission that proved to be very eventful.
    <h3>Detail</h3>
    <p><b>Yoda's lightsaber</b> unique was its scaled-down size.Aside from that particularity, the weapon had a simple design, <br>consisting of a studded chrome handle with black trim and an emitter shroud.</br> It contained a kyber crystal that put forth a bright green plasma blade</p>
